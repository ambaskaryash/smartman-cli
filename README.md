## 🤖 AI Explanations (Powered by Groq)

SmartMan CLI uses the lightning-fast **Groq API** to provide instant, plain-English explanations of complex manual pages.

1.  Get a free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/).
2.  Export it in your shell:
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY='your_key_here'
    ```
3.  Run:
    ```bash
    smartman --explain grep
    ```

## 🛠 Usage

Simply prefix any command you would normally use with `man` with `smartman`:

```bash
smartman grep
```

### Commands & Flags
*   `smartman <command>`: Launch the full interactive TUI.
*   `smartman --plain <command>`: Fall back to a beautiful Rich-rendered plain text view (great for quick lookups).

## 🐚 Shell Integration (Highly Recommended)

Make SmartMan your default manual viewer by adding an alias to your shell configuration (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):
